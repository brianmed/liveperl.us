# Mojolicious [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kraih/mojo.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kraih/mojo)

  Back in the early days of the web, many people learned Perl because of a
  wonderful Perl library called [CGI](http://metacpan.org/module/CGI). It was
  simple enough to get started without knowing much about the language and
  powerful enough to keep you going, learning by doing was much fun. While
  most of the techniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is not.
  Mojolicious is a new attempt at implementing this idea using state of the
  art technology.

## Features

  * An amazing real-time web framework, allowing you to easily grow single
    file [Mojolicious::Lite](http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojolicious/Lite)
    prototypes into well structured web applications.
    * Powerful out of the box with RESTful routes, plugins, commands, Perl-ish
      templates, content negotiation, session management, form validation,
      testing framework, static file server, first class Unicode support and
      much more for you to discover.
  * Very clean, portable and Object Oriented pure-Perl API without any hidden
    magic and no requirements besides Perl 5.10.1 (although 5.16+ is
    recommended, and optional CPAN modules will be used to provide advanced
    functionality if they are installed).
  * Full stack HTTP and WebSocket client/server implementation with IPv6, TLS,
    SNI, IDNA, Comet (long polling), keep-alive, connection pooling, timeout,
    cookie, multipart, proxy, and gzip compression support.
  * Built-in non-blocking I/O web server, supporting multiple event loops as
    well as optional preforking and hot deployment, perfect for embedding.
  * Automatic CGI and [PSGI](http://plackperl.org) detection.
  * JSON and HTML/XML parser with CSS selector support.
  * Fresh code based upon years of experience developing
    [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org).

## Installation

  All you need is a one-liner, it takes less than a minute.

    $ curl get.mojolicio.us | sh

  We recommend the use of a [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) environment.

## Getting Started

  These three lines are a whole web application.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/' => {text => 'Hello World!'};

app->start;
```

  To run this example with the built-in development web server just put the
  code into a file and start it with `morbo`.

    $ morbo hello.pl
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    Hello World!

## Duct tape for the HTML5 web

  Web development for humans, making hard things possible and everything fun.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

# Simple plain text response
get '/' => {text => 'I â™¥ Mojolicious!'};

# Route associating "/time" with template in DATA section
get '/time' => 'clock';

# Scrape information from remote sites
post '/title' => sub {
  my $self  = shift;
  my $url   = $self->param('url') || 'http://mojolicio.us';
  my $title = $self->ua->get($url)->res->dom->at('title')->text;
  $self->render(json => {url => $url, title => $title});
};

# WebSocket echo service
websocket '/echo' => sub {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->on(message => sub {
    my ($self, $msg) = @_;
    $self->send("echo: $msg");
  });
};

app->start;
__DATA__

@@ clock.html.ep
% use Time::Piece;
% my $now = localtime;
The time is <%= $now->hms %>.
```

  Single file prototypes like this one can easily grow into well-structured
  applications.
