0.991250  2009-08-18
  - This release contains many substantial changes that are not backwards
    compatible, but good news is that it's also the last major feature
    breaking release before 1.0. ;) Older releases of Mojo did contain
    additional Mojo::Script::* and Mojolicious::Script::* modules that are
    obsolete now and might break this version if they are still present on
    your system. Because of this we highly suggest that you DELETE ALL
    MODULES IN THE "Mojo", "MojoX" AND "Mojolicious" NAMESPACES MANUALLY!!!
  - Mojo::Script has been renamed to Mojo::Command, this change is not
    backwards compatible! You will have to regenerate application scripts or
    replace "Mojo(licious)::Script" with "Mojo(licious)::Command" manually.
  - Removed unused features from Mojo::Base and simplified API, this change
    is not backwards compatible!
      __PACKAGE__->attr('foo', default => 'bar');
    becomes
      __PACKAGE__->attr(foo => 'bar');
  - Merged eplite and epl, this change is not backwards compatible, you will
    have to rename all your eplite templates to epl.
  - Simplified MojoX::Renderer, this change is not backwards compatible!
    Handler can no longer be detected, that means "default_handler" or the
    "handler" argument are required. The template argument can no longer
    contain format or handler.
      $self->render(template => 'foo.html.epl');
    becomes
      $self->render('foo', format => 'html', handler => 'epl');
    The following forms are available now.
      $self->render;
      $self->render(controller => 'foo', action => 'bar');
      $self->render({controller => 'foo', action => 'bar'});
      $self->render(text => 'Hello!');
      $self->render(template => 'index');
      $self->render(template => 'foo/index');
      $self->render(
        template => 'index',
        format   => 'html',
        handler  => 'epl'
      );
      $self->render(handler => 'something');
      $self->render('foo/bar');
      $self->render('foo/bar', format => 'html');
      $self->render('foo/bar', {format => 'html'});
    For renderers the stash will no longer get an updated template, instead a
    new argument will be passed along.
        {template => 'foo/bar', format => 'html', handler => 'epl'}
  - Simplified context and controller in Mojolicious, this change is not
    backwards compatible! If you've been using a custom context object you'll
    now have to use a custom controller base class. The new controller_class
    attribute can now be used to set the default controller in Mojolicious.
    There is also no $c argument anymore actions get called with, since
    everything is in $self now.
  - Refactored and renamed Mojo::Transaction and Mojo::Pipeline, this change
    is not backwards compatible!
      Mojo::Transaction -> Mojo::Transaction::Single
      Mojo::Pipeline -> Mojo::Transaction::Pipeline
  - Refactored and renamed Mojo::File and Mojo::File::Memory, this change is
    not backwards compatible!
      Mojo::File -> Mojo::Asset::File
      Mojo::File::Memory -> Mojo::Asset::Memory
  - Refactored and renamed Mojo::Content, this change is not backwards
    compatible!
      Mojo::Content -> Mojo::Content::Single
